# Understanding In-context Learning from Repetition
This repo contains the code for the paper [Understanding In-context Learning from Repetition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00297
).

All codes are good to use. We are currently working to make it easier to use and will be updated soon. 

## Getting Started
Install dependencies. 
```bash
python setup.py install
```

Run the test code for random two tokens. 
```bash
bash run.sh
```
