Question: Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?
Let's think step by step
First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = 200 hours
Then calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $3000
Then multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $12,000
Now multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $4,000
Now multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000/manager * 2 managers = $8,000
Now add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $20,000
Now multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $2,000
Now add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $22,000
The answer is 22000

Question: In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons.  Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.  If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?
Let's think step by step
We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=10 adult women's skeletons.
The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= 5 of each.
Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=200 bones in total.
Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= 25 bones in their body.
There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25*5=125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.
Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= 10 bones in their body.
Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= 50 bones in the children's skeletons in total.
Therefore, altogether there are 50+125+200= 375 bones in total in the graveyard.
The answer is 375

Question: Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories.  The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats.  If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?
Let's think step by step
The number of shoes the factory made was 12000 dolls x 2 shoes/doll = 24000 shoes
The factory also made for each doll 12000 dolls x 3 bags/doll = 36000 bags
The set of cosmetics made for each doll was just one, so there are 12000 cosmetics sets
Finally, the number of hats for the dolls was 12000 dolls x 5 hats/doll = 60000 hats
In total, the number of accessories was 24000 + 36000 + 12000 + 60000 = 132000 accessories
The dolls took in total 12000 dolls x 45 seconds/doll = 540000 seconds to be made
All the accessories also took 132000 accessories x 10 seconds/accessory = 1320000 seconds
Combing both results, we have that the total time the machinery was working was 1320000 + 540000 = 1860000 seconds
The answer is 1860000

Question: Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
Let's think step by step
She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $144.00 per 8-hour shift
She works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = 2 hours of overtime
Overtime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $9.00
Her overtime pay is 18+9 = $27.00
Her base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $720.00
Her overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $54.00 in overtime pay
2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00
In 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $990.00
The answer is 990

Question: A printing press is printing brochures. The press prints 20 single-page spreads, and twice as many double-page spreads. For each 4 pages printed for the spreads, the press prints a block of 4 ads, each of which take up a quarter of a page. The brochures can be arranged in any order as long as they are made up of 5 pages each. How many brochures is the printing press creating?
Let's think step by step
There are a total of 20 single-page spreads * 2 = 40 double-page spreads.
As these are made up of 2 pages each, there are 40 double-page spreads * 2 pages = 80 pages in the double-page spreads.
In total, there are 20 single-pages + 80 double-pages = 100 pages in the spreads.
A block of ads is printed every 4 pages, so there will be 100 pages / 4 pages/block = 25 blocks of ads.
This is a total of 25 blocks * 4 ads = 100 ads.
As each ad takes up a quarter of a page, this must create an additional 100 ads * 0.25 = 25 pages.
Therefore, the press has printed 100 pages from the spreads + 25 pages of ads = 125 pages.
Since brochures are made up of 5 pages each, this creates a total of 125 pages / 5 = 25 brochures.
The answer is 25

Question: A spaceship is traveling to another planet. The spaceship travels at a consistent speed its entire journey unless it is stopped for the crew’s break. After launch, the spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours. It then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. After this, the spaceship would take an hour’s break after every 11 hours of traveling and maintained this routine until the end of its journey. If the entire journey took 3 days then how long, in hours, was the spaceship not moving?
Let's think step by step
On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 10 hours + 10 hours = 20 hours traveling.
On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 3 hours + 1 hour = 4 hours not moving.
This is a total of 20 hours traveling + 4 hours not moving = 24 hours or 1 day.
So the rest of the journey took place over 3 days journey – 1 first day = 2 days.
This is the same as 2 days * 24 hours = 48 hours.
In these 2 days, the spaceship’s time is split into 11 hours traveling + 1 hour break = 12 hour blocks.
So in the last 2 days, the spaceship wasn't moving for a total of 48 hours / 12 hour blocks = 4 hours.
Adding this to breaks from the first day shows that the spaceship was not moving for a total of 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
The answer is 8

Question: Alec is running for Class President. He thinks that if he can get three-quarters of the class to vote for him then there is no chance anyone else can beat him. Half of the class have already said they will vote for him but out of the remaining students, only 5 have said they are thinking about voting for him. He surveys the students who are thinking about voting for someone else, and changes his flyers to reflect the issues these students are concerned about. This results in a fifth of these students saying they'll vote for him. If Alec's class has 60 students and everyone who said they will vote for him does so, how many more votes does Alec need to reach his goal number of votes?
Let's think step by step
To calculate Alec's goal number of votes, we need to know that 60 students / 4 = 15 students is equal to one-quarter of the class students.
Alec's goal is therefore 15 students * 3 quarters = 45 votes.
Half of the class said they will vote for him, so there are already 60 students / 2 = 30 votes.
Another 5 students are thinking about voting for him which leaves a total so far of 30 + 5 = 35 votes.
This means there are 60 students - 35 voting for Alec = 25 students not voting for Alec.
A fifth of these decided to vote, so this is a further 25 students / 5 = 5 votes.
Alec is therefore receiving a total of 35 + 5 = 40 votes.
So he has missed his goal by 45 goal votes - 40 actual votes = 5 votes.
The answer is 5

Question: A curry house sells curries that have varying levels of spice. Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?
Let's think step by step
The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = 90 peppers for very spicy curries.
They also bought 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries = 60 peppers for spicy curries.
They also bought 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = 10 peppers for mild curries.
So they were previously buying 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers.
They now buy 2 peppers per spicy curry * 15 spicy curries = 30 peppers for spicy curries.
They also now buy 1 pepper per mild curry * 90 mild curries = 90 peppers for mild curries.
So they now buy 30 + 90 = 120 peppers.
This is a difference of 160 peppers bought originally - 120 peppers bought now = 40 peppers.
The answer is 40

Question: Jenny is planning her catering budget for her wedding. She's going to have 80 guests. 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. If each steak entree costs $25 and each chicken entree costs $18, how much is the total catering budget?
Let's think step by step
Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c.
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80
Combining like terms, we get 4c = 80
Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20
Then multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18/guest = $360
Then triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = 60 guests
Then multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25/guest = $1500
Then add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $1860
The answer is 1860
