Human:
Q: Statement 1 | Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group. Statement 2 | The symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) True, True 
(B) False, False 
(C) True, False 
(D) False, True

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: A cyclic group is a group that is generated by a single element. Hence a subgroup generated by a single element of a group is cyclic and Statement 1 is True. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: The symmetric group $S_n$ has $
actorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.
Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 0 
(B) 3 
(C) 12 
(D) 30

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. 
The answer is A.



Human:
Q: Statement 1| Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. Statement 2 | Every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) True, True 
(B) False, False 
(C) True, False 
(D) False, True

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Statement 1 is true. Let $S$ be a finite set. If $f:S 
ightarrow S$ is a onto function, then $|S| = |f(S)|$. If $f$ was not one to one, then for finite domain $S$ the image would have less than $S$ elements, a contradiction.
Statement 2 is true. Let $G$ be an abelian group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We need to show that $H$ is abelian. Let $a,b \in H$. Then $a,b \in G$ and $ab=ba$. Since $G$ is abelian, $ab=ba$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $ab \in H$. Therefore, $ab=ba$ and $H$ is abelian. 
The answer is A.



Human:
Q: Statement 1 | If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. Statement 2 | If H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) True, True 
(B) False, False 
(C) True, False 
(D) False, True

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Statement 2 is false. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $S_3$ generated by the cycle $(1,2)$ and $K$ be a subgroup of $S_3$ generated by the cycle $(1,3)$. Both $H$ and $K$ have two elements, the generators and the identity. However $HK$ contains cycles (1,2), (1,3) and (2,3,1), but the inverse of (2,3,1) is (2,1,3) and it does not belong to HK, hence HK is not a subgroup. 
The answer is B.



Human:
Q: Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 0 
(B) 1 
(C) 2 
(D) 3

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if x^2 + c does not have roots in Z_3. That is x^2 + c != 0 for every x in Z_3. If c = 0, then x^2 + c = x^2 has root 0. If c = 1 then x^2 + c = x^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 for x = 0, 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 1 and 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 2, hence x^2 + 1 does not have any roots. For c = 2 the polynomial x^2 + 2 has two roots at x = 1 and x = 2. Hence Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if c = 1. 
The answer is B.

Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Abdominal 
(B) Cranial 
(C) Pleural 
(D) Spinal

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. The pituitary gland is the major endocrine gland attached to the base of the brain, and it is contained in the Cranial cavity. 
The answer is B.



Human:
Q: Which of these branches of the trigeminal nerve contain somatic motor processes?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) The supraorbital nerve 
(B) The infraorbital nerve 
(C) The mental nerve 
(D) None of the above

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. 
We know the following: (A) The supraorbital nerve (also known as the frontal nerve) is the largest branch of the ophthalmic nerve and branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. (B) The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. (C) The mental nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Because all these nerves are purely sensory nerves and do not contain any somatic motor processes. Therefore, the answer should be none of the above, which is (D). 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: In Angle's Class II Div 2 occlusion there is
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) excess overbite of the upper lateral incisors. 
(B) negative overjet of the upper central incisors. 
(C) excess overjet of the upper lateral incisors. 
(D) excess overjet of the upper central incisors.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. This is a question related to anatomy and orthodontics. Excess overjet is associated with Class II occlusions; therefore, we can safely eliminate (B) from the list, as negative overjet is often associated with Class III occlusions. Now, we need to determine the location of the excess overjet, and that would be the upper (maxillary) lateral incisors. Only (C) has the correct information. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: The pleura
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) have no sensory innervation. 
(B) are separated by a 2 mm space. 
(C) extend into the neck. 
(D) are composed of respiratory epithelium.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First, recall that the pleura refers to the thin layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the interior wall of the chest cavity. Now, let’s look at each option:
Option (A): “The pleura have no sensory innervation.” This information is not correct. The pleura do have a sensory innervation.
Option (B): “The pleura are separated by a 2 mm space.” This information is not correct. There is a very thin “potential” space between the layers of the pleura; however, it is typically filled with serous pleural fluid. 
Option (C): “The pleura extend into the neck.” This information is actuakky true. The cervical pleura, also known as the dome of the pleuradome of the pleura, lines the extendsiton of the pleural cavity into the neck.
Option (D): “The pleura are composed of respiratory epithelium.” This information is not correct. The pleaura are composed of connective tissue (CT).
Because (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect, (D) is the only correct answer. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) The first pharyngeal arch 
(B) The first and second pharyngeal arches 
(C) The second pharyngeal arch 
(D) The second and third pharyngeal arches

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. The hyoid bone, which is also known as the hyooid, is a a small U-shaped bone located in the anterior neck. In its resting position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and the third cervical vertebrae. We know that the second and the third pharyngeal arches give rise to the horns of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological origin of the hyoid bone are the second and the third pharyngeal arches—this information is covered in the last option (D). Therefore, we conclude that (D) must be the correct answer. 
The answer is D.

Human:
Q: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. 
(B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt. 
(C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. 
(D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. 
The answer is A.



Human:
Q: You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. 
(B) It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars. 
(C) It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars. 
(D) It would be the same no matter where you are.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: If we assume that there is no friction, the force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton’s second law only dependent on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn’t matter that it’s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 10000 times more 
(B) 100 times more 
(C) 1000 times more 
(D) 10 times more

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. 
The answer is A.



Human:
Q: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision. 
(B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet. 
(C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. 
(D) Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it’s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: Why is Mars red?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized ("rusted") minerals. 
(B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light. 
(C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color. 
(D) Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). 
The answer is A.

Human:
Q: Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning arthropods?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan. 
(B) They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart. 
(C) They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources. 
(D) They lack paired, jointed appendages.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. 
The answer is B.



Human:
Q: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 1/400 
(B) 19/400 
(C) 20/400 
(D) 38/400

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\sqrt{rac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: According to the pressure-flow model of movement of phloem contents, photosynthate movement from source to sink is driven by
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) an ATP-dependent pressure-flow pump 
(B) a water-pressure potential gradient 
(C) transpiration 
(D) apoplastic diffusion

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: It is a gradient in water pressure that induces the movement of phloem content, which refers to answer (B). The mechanism of movement does not rely on metabolism, which rules out (A). Transpiration refers to the exhalation of water vapor through plant stomata, and is also not related, which rules out (C). While the apoplastic pathway is one of two main pathways for water transport in plants, it is not central to the pressure flow model, which rules out (D). 
The answer is B.



Human:
Q: Which of the following contain DNA sequences required for the segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Telomeres 
(B) Centromeres 
(C) Nucleosomes 
(D) Spliceosomes

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The genetic material in Telomeres is not used, which rules out (A). Nucleosomes are the repeating subunit that comprises chromatin packed in a cell nucleus, and do not specifically refer to DNA sequences necessary for segregating chromosomes in cell division, which rules out (C). A spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein that removes introns from transcribed pre-mRNA rather than governing chromosome segregation. Centromeres are directly responsible for segregating chromosomes in cell division. 
The answer is B.



Human:
Q: The presence of homologous structures in two different organisms, such as the humerus in the front limb of a human and a bird, indicates that
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) the human and bird are polyphyletic species 
(B) a human's and bird's evolution is convergent 
(C) the human and bird belong to a clade 
(D) the human and bird developed by analogy

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Polyphyletic species are organisms that are grouped due to having similar characteristics but which do not have a common ancestor. This is not the case for humans and birds, which rules out (A). Convergent evolution refers to the indepdendent development of similar features in different species at different periods, which is also not the case for humans and birds, which rules out (B). Analogy refers to the superficial resemblance of structures that have different origins, which is not the case for the human and bird forearms, which rules out (D). Humans and birds do belong to the same clade - a group of organisms composed of a common ancestor. 
The answer is C.

Q: 3 Cl−(aq) + 4 CrO_4^2−(aq) + 23 H+(aq) → 3 HClO2(aq) + 4 Cr3+(aq) + 10 H2O(l). In the reaction shown above, Cl−(aq) behaves as
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) an acid 
(B) a base 
(C) a catalyst 
(D) a reducing agent

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D). 
The answer is D.

(C) All of the lanthanide elements react with aqueous acid to liberate hydrogen. 
(D) The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements increase across the period from La to Lu.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements in fact decrease across the period from La to Lu. Options (A), (B), and (C) are all true. This means that only (D) is NOT true. 
The answer is D.

Q: Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4 
(B) PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 
(C) CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 
(D) CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (A). 
The answer is A.



Human:
Q: Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 4 
(B) 3 
(C) 6 
(D) 24 (E) 8

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = 
rac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. 
The answer is (E).

Q: Which of the following regular expressions is equivalent to (describes the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: (A) a*(c + d)+ b(c + d)
(B) a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*
(C) a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d)
(D) (a + b)*c +(a + b)*d

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We know that:
1. (X* + Y)* = (X + Y)*
2. X(Y + Z)? = XY + XZ
Using equation 1 we can rewrite (a* + b)*(c + d)? as:
3. (a + b)*(c + d)?
Using equation 2 we can rewrite equation 3 as:
(a + b)*c + (a + b)*d 
The answer is D.

Q: The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?
I. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.
II. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.
III. The Singleton class has a private constructor.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: (A) I only
(B) II only
(C) III only
(D) I, II, and III

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton. Statement III is also correct, because a Singletons must be instantiated only once, so its constructor is made private to prevent any construction except via its static factory method.
Given these facts, statements I, II, and III are all correct. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.
Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 5 
(B) 6 
(C) 7 
(D) 8

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.
Next, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.
Next, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.
We can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:
compute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3
compute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4
compute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5
compute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6
STALL
compute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7
So there are 6 cycles. 
The answer is B.

Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 5 
(B) 6 
(C) 7 
(D) 9

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:
1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)
2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)
3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)
4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)
5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)
6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)
7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)
8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
This sequence takes 9 instructions. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 1/50 
(B) 1/27 
(C) 1/25 
(D) 2/27

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.
Thus a given processor has:
(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =
(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:
misses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.
Next, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:
50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:
instructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.
Now, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:
lock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.
Thus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:
lock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =
(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. 
The answer is B.

Q: Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) ST = 0 
(B) ST = T 
(C) ST = TS 
(D) ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]
and
\[TS(p) = xp’(x).\]
Hence \[ST(p) - TS(p) = p(x) + xp’(x) - xp’(x).\] 
The answer is D.

Q: Suppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. If f is a polynomial and f(5) = 11, then f(15/2)
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) -11 
(B) 0 
(C) 11 
(D) 33/2

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The only polynomial so that $f(1 + x) = f(x)$ is a constant polynomial. Hence $f(5) = 11 = f(15/2)$. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: Let A be a real 2x2 matrix. Which of the following statements must be true?
I. All of the entries of A^2 are nonnegative.
II. The determinant of A^2 is nonnegative.
III. If A has two distinct eigenvalues, then A^2 has two distinct eigenvalues.
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) I only 
(B) II only 
(C) III only 
(D) II and III only

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We have \[ det(A^2) = (det(A))^2 \geq 0,\] hence II holds.
III is false: as a counterexample take a diagonal matrix with -1 and 1 on the diagonal. Then $A^2$ is the identity matrix. 
The answer is B.



Human:
Q: Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \in A}?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) -5 
(B) -4 
(C) -3 
(D) -2

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. 
The answer is B.



Human:
Q: A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 2 
(B) 2 - e^-2 
(C) 2 + e^-2 
(D) 2 + e^-4

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
rac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=rac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=rac{-1}{25}=rac{d}{d t}\left[-rac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. 
The answer is D.

(C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration 
(D) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let’s solve this step by step and go over each choice: 
Choices: (A) “Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate”: This is a correct statement.
(B) “Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles”: This is a correct statement.
(C) “Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration”: This is a correct statement. 
(D) “Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body”: This is not a correct statement, because insulin promotes glucose uptake by the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, but not all tissues. For instance, the tissues in the brain and red blood cells are not affected by insulin. 
The answer is D.

Q: A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm, and the room temperature is 25°C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all other variables are held constant?
Choices: 
(A) Increasing temperature, increasing moles of gas 
(B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume 
(C) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature 
(D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or T (temperature) have to increase. 
The answer is A.



Human:
Q: In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?
Choices: 
(A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. 
(B) Females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. 
(C) All daughters of an affected male will be affected. 
(D) There will be equal distribution of males and females affected.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let's recall first that females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. 
Because a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this rare genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, “(C): All daughters of an affected male will be affected” is a correct statement. 
The answer is C.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Glucose (also known as the blood sugar) is the main sugar found in the human body. It is transported into the muscle cell via diffusion through protein transporters called GLUT4. 
The answer is A.

Which one of the four choices is correct about the question, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 4 
(B) 5 
(C) 6 
(D) 20

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. 
The answer is A.

Choices: 
(A) charge 
(B) mass 
(C) energy and momentum 
(D) lepton number

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation. 
The answer is D.

Which one of the four choices is correct about the question, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 2.4 V 
(B) 3.3 V 
(C) 4.5 V 
(D) 5.7 V

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V. 
The answer is A.

Q: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?
Which one of the four choices is correct about the question, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Constant temperature 
(B) Constant volume 
(C) Constant pressure 
(D) Adiabatic

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy. 
The answer is B.

Q: Which of these three elements has the most mass per nucleon?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Hydrogen 
(B) Iron 
(C) Uranium 
(D) Same in each

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Due to nuclear binding energy, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons; this is known as the mass defect. Hydrogen has no mass defect because it has only a single nucleon, so it will have the most mass per nucleon. 
The answer is A.

Q: A model airplane flies slower when flying into the wind and faster with wind at its back. When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) the same 
(B) greater 
(C) less 
(D) either greater or less depending on wind speed

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The plane’s speed in the direction of the wind is greater than it would be in the absence of wind, and its direction orthogonal to the wind is the same as it would be in the absence of the wind. The total speed, which is these two components added in quadrature, is thus greater than the speed in still air. 
The answer is B.

Human:
Q: Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 1 lag 
(B) 2 lags 
(C) 3 lags 
(D) 4 lags

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First of all, let’s recall that for a given set of data, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) allows us to measure how well a statistical model fits the data; it is an estimator of prediction error. Here in this problem we will need to use the formula ln(det(sigma_hat)) + (2 * k / T) to determine the values of Akaike’s criterion, where ln denotes the natural log function, det the determinant function, k the total number of parameters in total (across both equations), and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal to 500). For 1 lag, the number of parameters in total is equal to 6; for 2 lags, it is 10; for 3 lags, it is 14; and for 4 lags, it is 18. Now, let’s calculate the values of the criterion for each lag:
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: (A) 1 lag: ln(0.0336) + (2 * 6 / 500) = ln(0.0336) + (12 / 500) = -3.369
(B) 2 lags: ln(0.0169) + (2 * 10 / 500) = ln(0.0169) + (20 / 500) = -4.040
(C) 3 lags: ln(0.0084) + (2 * 14 / 500) = ln(0.0084) + (28 / 500) =-4.724
(D) 4 lags: ln(0.0062) + (2 * 18 / 500) = ln(0.0062) + (36 / 500) =-5.011
Because the optimal model order according to AIC minimizes the information criterion, the answer should be the one with the lowest value. In this case, (D) has the lowest value. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance

The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 0.2 
(B) 0.4 
(C) 0.5 
(D) 0.33

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (D) 0.33. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: What would be then consequences for the OLS estimator if heteroscedasticity is present in a regression model but ignored?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) It will be biased 
(B) It will be inconsistent 
(C) It will be inefficient 
(D) All of (a), (b) and (c) will be true.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Heteroscedasticity refers to the condition where the variance of the error terms is not constant across multiple observations. If heteroscedasticity is present in a regression model, then the coefficient estimates in the OLS estimator will be not only unbiased and consistent but also inefficient. Because (A) and (B) are incorrect choices and (C) is a correct choice, (D) cannot be the right answer. Ultimately, (C) is the only true choice. 
The answer is C.

(A) (ii) and (iv) only 
(B) (i) and (iii) only 
(C) (i), (ii), and (iii) only 
(D) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).

Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s reason about each of the options.
(i) is a true statement.
(ii) is a true statement.
(iii) is a true statement.
(iv) is not a true statement. Thus, (i), (ii), and (iii) are true.

Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 15 N. 
(B) 20 N. 
(C) 7.5 N. 
(D) 3.75 N.

Choices: 
(A) 1 mA. 
(B) 2 mA. 
(C) 3 mA. 
(D) 4 mA.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The torque on a coil in a uniform magnetic field is given by BANI, where B is the magnetic flux density, A is the area of the coil, N is the number of turns, and I is the current. So we have that I = (Torque)/(BAN), or 240e-6/(1200e-6 * 100 * 1) = 2e-3. 
The answer is B.

Choices: 
(A) S=0, R=0 
(B) S=0, R=1 
(C) S=1, R=0 
(D) S=1, R=1

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: An SR latch is a set-reset latch; in the case where S=1 and R=1, the circuit has no stable state; instead a race condition will be produced within the circuit, so the device will be in an undefined state. So S=1, R=1 is an illegal input. 
The answer is D.

(A) 100 N. 
(B) 0.1 N. 
(C) 1 N. 
(D) 0.01 N.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The magnetic force-per-length between two current-carrying conductors is given by \mu_0 I_1 I_2 / (2 \pi r), where $r$ is the separation distance and I_1 and I_2 are the currents. Plugging in 100 A for I_1 and I_2, and 20 mm for r, gives 0.1 N. 
The answer is B.

(A) 200Ω 
(B) 100Ω 
(C) 50Ω 
(D) 10Ω

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: In lap winding, effectively two resistors are connected in parallel, so the actual resistance of each pair is 1 Ohm. Since we have 50 pairs, we get a total resistance of 50 Ohms. 
The answer is C.

Human:
Q: Olivia used the rule "Add 11" to create the number pattern shown below. 10, 21, 32, 43, 54. Which statement about the number pattern is true?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: (A) The 10th number in the pattern will be an even number.
(B) The number pattern will never have two even numbers next to each other.
(C) The next two numbers in the pattern will be an even number then an odd number.
(D) If the number pattern started with an odd number then the pattern would have only odd numbers in it.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Choice A is incorrect because every even-numbered term in the pattern is odd, and 10 is an even number. Choice B is correct, because adding an odd number (in this case 11) to an odd number produces an even number, and adding an odd number to an even number produces an odd number. Thus the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, so there will never be two even numbers next to each other. Choice C is incorrect because the last term in the example is even (54), and we know that the terms will alternate between even and odd. Choice D is incorrect because the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, regardless of the value of the first term. 
The answer is B.

Choices: (A) Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.
(B) Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.
(C) Multiply 30 and 5 to find 150 teams.
(D) Subtract 5 from 30 to find 25 teams.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams. 
The answer is B.



Human:

(C) (5 x 5) + (5 x 9)
(D) (5 x 9) x (6 x 9)

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We know that 9 = (5 + 4), so 5 x 9 = 5 x (5 + 4) = (5 x 5) + (5 x 4). 
The answer is B.

(C) Bglh 
(D) Bghl

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. We are told that “Bxyx” means “x borrows y from z”. We can rewrite “George borrows Hector's lawnmower” as “George borrows a lawnmower from Hector”, which can then be translated into predicate logic as “Bglh”. The answer “Bglh” appears in (C); therefore, (C) must be the correct answer.

Choices: 
(A) Marina is a dancer. Some weaklings are not dancers. Either everything is a weakling or Georgia plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball. 
(B) Marina is a dancer. No weakling is a dancer. Everything is either a weakling or plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball. 
(C) Marina is a dancer. Some weaklings are not dancers. Everything is either a weakling or plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball. 
(D) Marina is a dancer. No weakling is a dancer. Either everything is a weakling or Georgia plays volleyball. So something plays volleyball.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “D” denote “being a dancer”, “m” denote “Maria”, “g” denote “Georgia”, “W” denote “weakling”, “A” denote “playing volleyball”. Then, we have the following:
1. Dm → Maria is a dance.
2. (∀x)(Wx ⊃ ~Dx). → For all x, if x is a weakling, then x is not a dancer. In other words, no weakling is a dancer.
3. (∀x)Wx ∨ Ag	/ (∃x)Ax → For all x, x is a weakling or Georgia plays volleyball. So there exists an x that plays volleyball. 
Options (A) and (C) do claim that some weaklings are not dancers, but the second argument strongly states that no weakling is a dancer. Thus, we can eliminate them. Option (B) omits the important detail about Georgia playing volleyball. Option (D) has all the details presented in the arguments and is the best English interpretation of the arguments. 
The answer is D.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “P” denote “being on Mars” and “D” denote “driving on Mars”. Then let’s consider each option:
Option (A): ~Pd → d is not on Mars.
Option (B): (∀x)(Px ∨ ~Dx) → For all x, x is on Mars and x do not drive on Mars.
Option (C): (∀x)(Px ⊃ ~Dx) → For all x, x is on Mars implies that x do not drive on Mars.
Option (D): ~Dp: → p do not drive on Mars.
Of all these options, Option (C) appears to be the best and most meaningful interpretation of the argument “No people drive on Mars.” 
The answer is C.

Human:
Q: In animal cells, which of the following represents the most likely pathway that a secretory protein takes as it is synthesized in a cell?
Choices: 
(A) Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER 
(B) Ribosome–Golgi apparatus–rough ER–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane 
(C) Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER 
(D) Ribosome–rough ER–Golgi apparatus–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Protein synthesis starts at the ribosome, so we can eliminate (A) and (C). The ribosome is often in the endoplasmic reticulum and moves from there to the Golgi apparatus, where it is modified and packaged into a vesicle. The vesicle then floats to the plasma membrane and is secreted. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?
Choices: 
(A) By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum 
(B) By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell 
(C) By changing the shape of the protein 
(D) An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. 
The answer is C.

Q: Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT
Choices: 
(A) the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat 
(B) the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man 
(C) the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal 
(D) the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: ​​Homologous structures are similar physical features in organisms that share a common ancestor ​​but different functions. Comparisons (B) and (C) are clearly homologous because they share a common ancestor and the structures serve different purposes. Bat wings and birg wings are also homologous, while they are both wings, the forelimbs serve different purposes. Insects and dogs are very far ancestors since one is vertebrate while the other is invertebrate and the forelimbs serve the same purpose, so they are not homologous. 
The answer is D.

Choices: 
(A) Cyclins 
(B) Protein kinases 
(C) Checkpoints 
(D) Fibroblast cells

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Normal cells move through the cell cycle in a regulated way. At the checkpoint stage, they use information about their own internal state and cues from the environment around them to decide whether to proceed with cell division. Cues like these act by changing the activity of core cell cycle regulators inside the cell. The most common regulators are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Fibroblast cells do not play any role in cell division. 
The answer is D.

Q: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) HCl 
(B) H2SO3 
(C) SO2 
(D) Al(NO3)3

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: Which of the following is expected to be a polar molecule?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) PCl4F 
(B) BF3 
(C) CO2 
(D) Si
(CH3)4

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: A polar molecule is one that has a slightly positive charge on one end of the molecule and a slightly negative charge on the other end. Boron trifluoride (BF3) has Boron as the center atom and three fluorine atoms attached to it; it is trigonal planar and symmetric, so it is nonpolar. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has Carbon as the central atom with double bonds to two Oxygen atoms - this is also symmetrical and therefore nonpolar. The same is the case for tetramethyl silane (SI(CH3)4), which is a Silicon atom surrounded by four methyl groups. The structure of PCL4F is that Phosphorus is the central atom, attached to four chlorines and one fluorine atom. This is asymmetrical, and therefore has a net dipole and is expected to be a polar molecule. 
The answer is A.



Human:
Q: From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble 
(B) All sulfates are soluble 
(C) All hydroxides are soluble 
(D) All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The chlorides, bromides, and iodides of lead, silver, and mercury are not soluble in water. This rules out (A). The sulfates of lead, barium, and calcium are not soluble in water, which rules out (B). The hydroxides of any metal besides sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, and barium are insoluble. This rules out (C). Typically ammonium ions indicate a soluble ionic substance. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 3.89 
(B) 7.78 
(C) 5.78 
(D) 2.33

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $
rac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 
rac{10^{-3.89} \cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 0.500 mole 
(B) 1.00 mole 
(C) 2.00 mole 
(D) 3.00 mole

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O 
ightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. 
The answer is C.

Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) A car alerts a driver that it is about to hit an object. 
(B) A hiker uses a G P S watch to keep track of her position. 
(C) A refrigerator orders milk from an online delivery service when the milk in the refrigerator is almost gone. 
(D) A runner uses a watch with optical sensors to monitor his heart rate.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to common devices which are connected to the internet, enabling new functionality. Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe an internet connected device. In choice B, the watch is only described as having GPS functionality but no internet connectivity. Choice C describes a common device (a refrigerator) which has internet connectivity enabling new functionality (online ordering). Choice D does not mention internet connectivity for the watch, only optical sensors. 
The answer is C.

Q: Many Web browsers allow users to open anonymous windows. During a browsing session in an anonymous window, the browser does not record a browsing history or a list of downloaded files. When the anonymous window is exited, cookies created during the session are deleted. Which of the following statements about browsing sessions in an anonymous window is true?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) The activities of a user browsing in an anonymous window will not be visible to people who monitor the user's network, such as the system administrator. 
(B) Items placed in a Web store's shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user's computer. 
(C) A user will not be able to log in to e-mail or social media accounts during the anonymous browsing session. 
(D) A user browsing in an anonymous window will be protected from viruses launched from any web sites visited or files downloaded.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Choice A is incorrect as it only describes network traffic, which an anonymous browser does not change. Choice B is correct as it correctly describes how an anonymous browser will prevent saving data on the user’s computer after the session is ended. Choice C is incorrect because an anonymous browser will not prevent logging in to email or social media accounts. Choice D is incorrect because an anonymous browser in itself performs no virus protection. 
The answer is B.

 } ELSE {
  IF (Y > 0){
   DISPLAY ("November")
  } ELSE {
   DISPLAY ("Yankee")
  }
 }
}
What is displayed as a result of running the program?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Foxtrot 
(B) Hotel 
(C) November 
(D) Yankee

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Because X has the value 5, the first conditional IF (X < 0) is false, so we move to the first ELSE clause. Because X is 5 and Y is 10, the second conditional IF (X > Y) is false, so we move to the following ELSE clause. Since Y is 10, the conditional IF (Y > 0) is true, so the command DISPLAY ("November") is executed. 
The answer is C.

(B) abc 
(C) cba 
(D) c

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We know that the slicing operator [::-1] takes all of the elements in the string in reverse order, so we reverse the order of the string "abc", resulting in "cba". 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.
 Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.
 Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater than 100, increase the value of count by 1.
 Step 3: (missing step)
 Step 4: (missing step)
 Step 5: Display the value of count.
Which of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: (A) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.
  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.
(B) Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.
  Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of position is greater than n.
(C) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of count is greater than 100.
  Step 4: Increase the value of position by 1.
(D) Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of position is greater than n.
  Step 4: Increase the value of count by 1.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Choice A is incorrect, because its Step 4 has an incorrect termination condition, stopping when count is greater than 100. We need to stop after inspecting all elements in the list. Choice B is correct because it correctly increments both count and position, and correctly repeats these steps and terminates when all elements in the list have been inspected. Choice C is incorrect because it incorrectly increments the variable count until its value is greater than 100, regardless of the elements in the list. Choice D is incorrect because its step 3 does not increment the value of position, so it will repeat forever. 
The answer is B.

Human:
Q: This question refers to the following information.
Read the following excerpt.
The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.
—Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820
Which of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?
Choices: 
(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe. 
(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power. 
(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur. 
(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on european history for help. The fears of revolution in early 19th century Europe expressed by Klemens von Metternich, a conservative Austrian statesman, were a direct result of the age of Enlightenment, a period of European history where the absolute power of the monarchy was challenged with ideas of individual liberty and nationalism, leading to the French revolution and its effects all over Europe.

[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.
Which of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?
Choices: 
(A) They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century. 
(B) They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended. 
(C) They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.

Q: This question refers to the following information.
In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…
"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery."
Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.
His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:
"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place."
émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885

Q: This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 55 
(B) 60 
(C) 62 
(D) 65

Assistant:

Q: The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\frac{1}{2}$?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) -1 
(B) 16 
(C) -\frac{1}{256} 
(D) \frac{1}{16}

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We know that $x \propto y^2$ and $y \propto z^3$, so $x = k z^6$ for some constant $k$. Plugging in for $x=-16$ and $z=2$, the constant value is $k=\frac{x}{z^6}=\frac{-16}{64}=-\frac{1}{4}$. So, when $z=\frac{1}{2}$, the value of $x$ is $x=kz^6=-\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{2^6}=-\frac{1}{256}$. 
The answer is C.

Choices: 
(A) Free entry into and exit from the market 
(B) A few large producers 
(C) One producer of a good with no close substitutes 
(D) A homogenous product

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. An oligopoly is when a market is dominated by just one or a few number of sellers or producers. To get oligopoly, the market should have high barriers to new entry, and the product has differentiation. 
The answer is B.

Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) the demand for the product will increase 
(B) the demand for the product will decrease 
(C) the consumer surplus will increase 
(D) the consumer surplus will decrease

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. (A) and (B) are wrong because the demand curve does not change at all. If the government subsidizes producers, the supply will increase, and thus the consumer surplus also increases. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: Which of the following is true of a price floor?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) The price floor shifts the demand curve to the left. 
(B) An effective floor creates a shortage of the good. 
(C) The price floor shifts the supply curve of the good to the right. 
(D) To be an effective floor, it must be set above the equilibrium price.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Price floor does not shift the demand or shift curve. An effective price floor should be set above the equilibrium price, otherwise the market bears and the floor does not have effective effect. 
The answer is D.

Choices: 
(A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode. 
(B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node. 
(C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. 
(D) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: At the closed end of the pipe, the particles cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to be maximal, i.e. an antinode. 
The answer is B.

Q: A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams 
(B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams 
(C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams 
(D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.

Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5 
(B) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13 
(C) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17 
(D) There is insufficient information to answer this question.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. 
The answer is D.

Choices: 
(A) I, II 
(B) II, III 
(C) III, I 
(D) III, II

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. 
The answer is D.



Human:
Q: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?

(B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. 
(C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. 
(D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. 
The answer is D.

Q: This question refers to the following information.
"As our late Conduct at the Conestoga Manor and Lancaster have occasioned much Speculation & a great diversity of Sentiments in this and neighboring Governments; some vindicating & others condemning it; some charitably alleviating the Crime, & others maliciously painting it in the most odious & detestable Colours, we think it our duty to lay before the Publick, the whole Matter as it appeared, & still appears, to us. . . .
"If these things are not sufficient to prove an unjustifiable Attachment in the Quakers to the Indians Savages, a fixed Resolution to befriend them & an utter insensibility to human Distresses, let us consider a few more recent Facts. When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter."

Human:
Q: This question refers to the following information.
Our leaders talk about stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups of Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, "A plague on both your houses." … Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.

Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation."
Abigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams, 1776
"Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no means secure."

Q: This question refers to the following information.
"Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others."

Q: This question refers to the following information.
"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck."

Q: This question refers to the following information.
"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny."

A: Because the input is real valued, it is unlikely that the same values appear both at training and test time. This means that while such a decision tree could yield good performance on the training data, when evaluated on the test data it will perform badly because the decision tree won’t know what to do with numbers that did not appear in the training data. 
The answer is C.



Human:
Q: You are reviewing papers for the World’s Fanciest Machine Learning Conference, and you see submissions with the following claims. Which ones would you consider accepting?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) My method achieves a training error lower than all previous methods! 
(B) My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter λ is chosen so as to minimise test error.) 
(C) My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter λ is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.) 
(D) My method achieves a cross-validation error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter λ is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.)

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: In machine learning, we train with some data and fixed hyperparameters and the training error can be arbitrarily low, so (A) can’t be right. Then, one compares different hyperparameters by selecting the model with the lowest cross-validation error, this means that (B) and (D) are not the right procedure. The only relevant number after these is the test error and thus (C) is the right answer. 
The answer is C.

Q: A 6-sided die is rolled 15 times and the results are: side 1 comes up 0 times; side 2: 1 time; side 3: 2 times; side 4: 3 times; side 5: 4 times; side 6: 5 times. Based on these results, what is the probability of side 3 coming up when using Add-1 Smoothing?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) 2.0/15 
(B) 1.0/7 
(C) 3.0/16 
(D) 1.0/5

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: Add-1 smoothing adds the value of one to the different counts and then normalizes the probabilities accordingly. The counts after adding one will be: side 1 comes up 1 time; side 2: 2 times; side 3: 3 times; side 4: 4 times; side 5: 5 times; side 6: 6 times. The number of sum one die rolls will be 21, so the probability of drawing a three is 3/21 = 1/7. 
The answer is B.

Q: To achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Hoeffding's inequality the IID test set must have how many examples?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) around 10 examples 
(B) around 100 examples 
(C) between 100 and 500 examples 
(D) more than 1000 examples

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: By the Hoeffding’s inequality, we expect that with 95% probability the in-sample and out-of-sample errors differ by epsilon when we have N samples if 2 exp(-2 epsilon^2 N)<0.05, this implies that N > -1/(2*epsilon**2) log ( 0.05/2 )= log (40)*5000. Since log(40)>1, we have that one needs more than 1000 examples. 
The answer is D.

Human:
Q: A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. 
(B) Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. 
(C) The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. 
(D) By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. 

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The doctrine of promissory estoppel stops a person from going back on a promise in contract law, hence option (A) should be the most persuasive argument.

Q: On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. 
(B) grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. 
(C) deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. 
(D) deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as "a structure" within the terms of the restriction. 

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The restrictions in the original plan say no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. Hence the court will most likely grant relief because the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. 
The answer is B.

To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, "Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. " The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. 
(B) the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment. 
(C) the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose. 
(D) the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on law for help. The Fourteenth Amendment further supports the First Amendment by establishing a due process clause. Hence the strongest argument should be the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
The answer is D.

Human:
Q: What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. 
(B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. 
(C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). 
(D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.

Human:
Q: How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. 
(B) By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. 
(C) The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. 
(D) Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.

Assistant:

Human:
Q: What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?
Which one of the four choices is correct, (A), (B), (C) or (D)?
Choices: 
(A) Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. 
(B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. 
(C) Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. 
(D) Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.

Assistant:
Let's think step by step. 
A: We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the opponent to comply with demands.
