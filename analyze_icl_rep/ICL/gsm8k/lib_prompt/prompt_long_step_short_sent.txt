Question: In a fruit salad, there are raspberries, green grapes, and red grapes. There are seven more than 3 times the number of red grapes as green grapes. There are 5 less raspberries than green grapes. If there are 102 pieces of fruit in the salad, how many red grapes are in the salad?
Let's think step by step
Green grapes = G
Red grapes = 3G + 7
Raspberries = G - 5
G + 3G + 7 + G - 5 = 102
5G + 2 = 102
5G = 100
G = 20
3 * 20 + 7 = 67
There are 67 red grapes.
The answer is 67

Question: The bowl of fruit contains apples, pears, and bananas. There are two more pears than apples, and three more bananas than pears.  If the bowl contains 19 pieces of fruit, how many bananas does it contain?
Let's think step by step
Let A be the number of apples.
There are A+2 pears.
There are (A+2)+3 pears.
Then A+(A+2)+((A+2)+3)=19.
3A+7=19
3A=12
A=4
There are 4 apples.
There are (4+2)+3=9 bananas.
The answer is 9

Question: Together 3 friends watched 411 short videos. Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon. Ekon watched 17 less than Uma. How many videos did Kelsey watch?
Let's think step by step
Let U = the number of videos Uma watched
Ekon = U - 17
Kelsey = (U - 17) + 43 = U + 26
U + U - 17 + U + 26 = 411
3U + 9 = 411
3U = 402
U = 134
Kelsey = 134 + 26 = 160 videos
Kelsey watched 160 videos.
The answer is 160

Question: Megan pays $16 for a shirt that costs $22 before sales. What is the amount of the discount?
Let's think step by step
Let x be the amount of the discount.
We have, 22 - x = $16
We change the writing of the equation:
22 - x + x = 16 + x
So, 22 = 16 + x
We then Remove 16 from both sides:
22 - 16 = 16 + x - 16
So, 22 - 16 = x
So, the amount of the discount is x = $6.
The answer is 6

Question: The total average age of three friends is 40. Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, and Molly's age is 30. How old is Hakimi?
Let's think step by step
The total age for the three friends is 40*3 = 120
If Molly's age is 30, then Jared and Hakimi have a total age of 120-30 = 90.
Let's say the age of Hakimi is x.
Since Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi, Jared is x+10 years old.
Jared and Hakimi's total age is x+(x+10) = 90
This translates to 2x=90-10
2x=80
Hakimi's age is x=80/2
This gives us x=40, which is Hamkimi's age.
The answer is 40

Question: In a certain school, 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, but only 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball. What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?
Let's think step by step
The students are divided into 3 + 2 = 5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.
Each part represents 1000/5 = 200 students.
So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males.
And there are 2 x 200 = 400 females.
Hence, 600 x 2/3 = 400 males play basketball.
And 400 x 1/5 = 80 females play basketball.
A total of 400 + 80 = 480 students play basketball.
Therefore, 1000 - 480 = 520 do not like to play basketball.
The percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 520/1000 * 100 = 52
The answer is 52

Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?
Let's think step by step
Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $120 worth of highlighters.
He bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.
Sam then took 5 boxes Ã— 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.
He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15
After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.
These form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.
He sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.
In total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.
Since his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.
The answer is 115

Question: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.  At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers.  She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.  Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?
Let's think step by step
After one week, Susy has 100+40 = 140 followers.
In the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.
In the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.
In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140+20+10 = 170 total followers.
After one week, Sarah has 50+90 = 140 followers.
After the second week, Sarah gains 90/3 = 30 followers.
After the third week, Sarah gains 30/3 = 10 followers.
So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140+30+10 = 180 total followers.
Thus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180.
The answer is 180
