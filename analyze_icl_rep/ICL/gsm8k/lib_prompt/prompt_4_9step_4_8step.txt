Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?
Let's think step by step
Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.
For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.
Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.
However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.
They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.
And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.
So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.
They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75
They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.
The answer is 4

Question: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.  What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?
Let's think step by step
Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.
His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers
They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.
All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points
Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.
His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers.
They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws.
All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points
The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points
The answer is 201

Question: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?
Let's think step by step
When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24
The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84
If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.
If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14
Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
The answer is 140

Question: A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there?
Let's think step by step
For the first three baskets, the number of apples and oranges in one basket is 9+15=24
In total, together with bananas, the number of fruits in one basket is 24+14=38 for the first three baskets.
Since there are three baskets each having 38 fruits, there are 3*38=114 fruits in the first three baskets.
The number of apples in the fourth basket is 9-2=7
There are also 15-2=13 oranges in the fourth basket
The combined number of oranges and apples in the fourth basket is 13+7=20
The fourth basket also contains 14-2=12 bananas.
In total, the fourth basket has 20+12=32 fruits.
The four baskets together have 32+114=146 fruits.
The answer is 146

Question: Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?
Let's think step by step
First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = 200 hours
Then calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $3000
Then multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $12,000
Now multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $4,000
Now multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000/manager * 2 managers = $8,000
Now add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $20,000
Now multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $2,000
Now add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $22,000
The answer is 22000

Question: In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons.  Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.  If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?
Let's think step by step
We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=10 adult women's skeletons.
The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= 5 of each.
Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=200 bones in total.
Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= 25 bones in their body.
There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25*5=125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.
Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= 10 bones in their body.
Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= 50 bones in the children's skeletons in total.
Therefore, altogether there are 50+125+200= 375 bones in total in the graveyard.
The answer is 375

Question: Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories.  The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats.  If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?
Let's think step by step
The number of shoes the factory made was 12000 dolls x 2 shoes/doll = 24000 shoes
The factory also made for each doll 12000 dolls x 3 bags/doll = 36000 bags
The set of cosmetics made for each doll was just one, so there are 12000 cosmetics sets
Finally, the number of hats for the dolls was 12000 dolls x 5 hats/doll = 60000 hats
In total, the number of accessories was 24000 + 36000 + 12000 + 60000 = 132000 accessories
The dolls took in total 12000 dolls x 45 seconds/doll = 540000 seconds to be made
All the accessories also took 132000 accessories x 10 seconds/accessory = 1320000 seconds
Combing both results, we have that the total time the machinery was working was 1320000 + 540000 = 1860000 seconds
The answer is 1860000

Question: Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
Let's think step by step
She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $144.00 per 8-hour shift
She works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = 2 hours of overtime
Overtime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $9.00
Her overtime pay is 18+9 = $27.00
Her base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $720.00
Her overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $54.00 in overtime pay
2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00
In 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $990.00
The answer is 990
